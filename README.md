## Tasks

1. **Data Import and Cleaning:**
   - Imported the data and utilized Power Query for data transformation.
   - Corrected spelling and punctuation errors in the expense type column.
   - Standardized project names for uniformity.
   - Created a custom column to handle missing values in the Currency column using the following formula:
     ```sh
     if [Currency] = null and [Amount] >= 1000 then "INR" 
     else if [Currency] = null and [Amount] < 1000 then "USD" 
     else [Currency]
     ```
   - Normalized the amount column to INR based on the currency.

2. **Creating Measures and Calculations:**
   - Created a measure to calculate the sum of reimbursed amounts in INR.
   - Used the CALCULATE function to determine the total reimbursed amount for Project_B.
   - Created a measure to count declined requests.

3. **Visualizations:**
   - Created a slicer visual for the Project and Employee.
   - Created a bar chart for Employees and Reimbursement Amount.
   - Created a pie chart for Project vs Reimbursement Amount.

## Results

- Successfully cleaned and prepared the dataset.
- Created meaningful measures to derive insights.
